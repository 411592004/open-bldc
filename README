This project aims to create a fully open-source Brushless Drive Controller.

Current design
--------------
The current design uses an STM32 microcontroller, Allegro halsensor based
current sensors, irs2101 bridge drivers. This combination will allow:

- Vectorfield control for smooth and very exact torque and speed control
- N-Mosfet only powerstage design to increase efficiency
- Many different interfaces (PPM, I2C, CAN, USART, USB) for interfacing

Inspiration references
----------------------
Some application notes were consulted while designing the circuits of
the drive conntrollers:

Also some inspiration was taken from the brushless controllers designed by
Holger Buss for the Mikrokopter project (http://www.mikrokopter.de). But the
design is constantly changing and moving away from designs that were considered
as inspirations quickly.

For more information take a look at http://open-bldc.org. A lot of progress
reports are posted on http://www.esden.net, so this page may be worth a look
too.
