This Project has the target to create a compleatly open source Brushless Drive Controller.

The controller uses an Atmega168 controller from Atmel.

Some Application notes were consulted while designing the circuits of
the Drive Conntrollers:

Also some inspiration was taken from the brushless controllers
designed by Holger Buss for the Mikrokopter project.
