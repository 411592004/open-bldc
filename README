This project aims to create a fully open-source Brushless Drive Controller.

The controller in the current designs uses an Atmega168 microcontroller from
Atmel. In the near future this will be changed to STM32 from st.com.

Some application notes were consulted while designing the circuits of
the drive conntrollers:

Also some inspiration was taken from the brushless controllers designed by
Holger Buss for the Mikrokopter project (http://www.mikrokopter.de). But the
design is constantly changing and moving away from designs that were considered
as inspirations quickly.

For more information take a look at http://open-bldc.org. A lot of progress
reports are posted on http://www.esden.net, so this page may be worth a look
too.
